# e-Mobility for All (e-Mall)

The project has been conducted following the assignment for the Software Engineering II course held by Professor Matteo Camilli at Politecnico di Milano A.Y. 2022-2023. 

The objective of this project is to apply in practice what we learned during lectures to become familiar with software engineering practices and be able to address new software engineering issues rigorously. The project is divided into two assignments:

- The definition of a Requirement Analysis and Specification Document (RASD), starting from an informal description of the problem.
- The definition of the Design Document (DD), based on the RASD document.

The main challenge of a massive deployment of electric mobility is the reduction
of transportationâ€™s impact on climate by limiting the carbon footprint caused
by our urban and sub-urban mobility everyday needs.
With this in mind, our aim is to develop and implement a new system called
eMall having the purpose to expand the electric charging infrastructure with
the means of realizing a world-wide network which fully connects all the actors
involved in the charging processes.
